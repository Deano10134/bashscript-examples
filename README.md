# Bashscript Examples.

## This repository will have example bash scripts that can be used on Ubuntu Linux machines and anyone can add to the scripts.
The repository will list bash scripts that I have learnt in my current course. The simple bash scripts will include how to edit a ./bashrc configuration file and how to write a bash script to find out system information.
